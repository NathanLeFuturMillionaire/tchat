Hello and welcome to the README file!

- This project has been started by Nathan Le Fütür Milliønãîre, he's the owner. 

Chatting with friends is now an important thing to get in touch
with our most close friends, that's why I decided to build a chat app
where users can chat between them. The beginning of this app goes back to
17th December 2023 at 6pm.

The goal is to build a website where peole can chat, but will not be published on the internet.

Prerequisites to join the project :
  - Have a good knowledge in HTML, CSS and PHP
  - Have a good knowledge in English

This PHP code is a procedural one, so make sure to know how to code with it.
